Get Fiscal running and set up your first budget in about five minutes.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g fscl
```

## Create your first budget

Run the init wizard to create a budget and write your config:

```bash
fscl init
```

You'll be asked to choose a mode:

- **local** — Creates a budget on your machine. No server needed. Pick this if you're just getting started or don't plan to use the Actual Budget web UI.
- **remote** — Pulls down a budget that already exists on an [Actual Budget server](https://actualbudget.org/docs/installing/). Pick this if you're already using Actual Budget and want to manage it from the CLI.

If you start local and later want to sync to a server, run `fscl budgets push`.

## Install the agent skills

Fiscal includes a comprehensive set of [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/) that teach your AI agent how to act as your personal accountant — managing your budget, handling imports, and categorizing transactions so you don't have to memorize any commands.

In interactive mode, `fscl init` asks whether to install these skills for you.

```bash
npx skills add fiscal-sh/fscl
```

If you run `fscl init --non-interactive`, run this command manually.

This works with Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, and [other agents that support skills](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills#supported-agents).

## Start using it

With the skill installed, just talk to your agent in plain language:

> Help me set up my budget with fscl.

The agent will ask about your bank accounts, income, and spending categories, then create everything using fscl commands behind the scenes. You don't need to know the CLI — just answer its questions.

### Day-to-day tasks

Once your budget exists, hand off routine work to your agent:

**Import a bank statement:**

> Import ~/Downloads/january-checking.ofx into my checking account and categorize everything.

The agent will import the file, run your rules to auto-categorize known payees, and ask you about anything it doesn't recognize. It creates rules as it goes so future imports get smarter.

**Check your budget:**

> How am I doing this month?

**Set up next month:**

> Set up my budget for March. Same as last month but bump groceries to $600.
