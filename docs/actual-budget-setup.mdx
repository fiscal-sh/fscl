description: Set up an Actual Budget server so you can visualize your Fiscal budget in a web dashboard.

Fiscal enables agents to manage your budget data through the `fscl cli`, but sometimes you want a visual dashboard — charts, graphs, and a calendar view of your transactions. [Actual Budget](https://actualbudget.org/) provides exactly that. This guide walks you through setting up an Actual Budget server and connecting it to Fiscal.

## Why run a server?

Without a server, Fiscal stores your budget locally and everything works fine. Adding a server gives you:

- **A web dashboard** at `http://localhost:5006` for visual budgeting
- **Sync** between the CLI and the web UI — changes in either show up in both
- **Multi-device access** if you expose the server on your network

## Start the server

<Aside title="Prerequisites">
    - This guide assumes you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed and running.
</Aside>

With the following command Docker will launch a pre-built image with the full Actual Budget server inside it:

```bash
docker run --pull=always --restart=unless-stopped -d \
  -p 5006:5006 \
  -v ~/actual-data:/data \
  --name actual-budget \
  actualbudget/actual-server:latest
```

Note that the The `-v ~/actual-data:/data` flag persists your data to a directory on your machine — without it, data only exists inside the container and is lost when the container is removed.

## Verify the server is running

You should see output like:

```bash
actual_server-1  | Listening on :::5006...
```

## Set your password

Open [http://localhost:5006](http://localhost:5006) in your browser. On first visit, Actual Budget asks you to create a password. Enter it and confirm.

There is no username — just a single server-wide password. Keep it safe; there's no recovery flow (though you can reset it with `--reset-password` if you have server access).

## Connect Fiscal to the server

Pass the server URL and the password you just created:

```bash
fscl budgets create "My Budget" --mode local
fscl budgets push \
  --server-url http://localhost:5006 \
  --password YOUR_PASSWORD
```

This creates the budget locally, then uploads it to the server. If you already have a local budget, run only `fscl budgets push`.

To avoid passing credentials every time, add them to your config or environment:

```bash
# Environment variables
export FISCAL_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:5006
export FISCAL_PASSWORD=YOUR_PASSWORD
```

Or in `~/.config/fscl/config.json`:

```json
{
  "serverUrl": "http://localhost:5006",
  "password": "YOUR_PASSWORD"
}
```

## Open the dashboard

Navigate to [http://localhost:5006](http://localhost:5006) and log in with your password. You'll see your budget, accounts, transactions, and reports — all synced with what Fiscal manages on the CLI.

Changes flow both ways: edits in the web UI appear in `fscl` commands, and CLI changes appear in the dashboard after a sync.

## Stopping and restarting

```bash
# Stop the server
docker stop actual-budget

# Start it again (data persists in the volume)
docker start actual-budget
```

To remove and recreate:

```bash
docker rm actual-budget
# Re-run the docker run command from above
```

## Updating

```bash
docker pull actualbudget/actual-server:latest
docker stop actual-budget && docker rm actual-budget
# Re-run the docker run command from above
```
